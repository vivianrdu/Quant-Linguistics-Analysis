1. Regular Expressions
a. \\b(be|were|was)\\b\\s\\b([a-z]+)(ed|en)\\b

b. An example that the pattern will find is "were keen" (false positive). This is not correct since the word "keen" is not a verb, but rather an adjective that ends in "en". A false negative would be "were fought", because the word "fight" conjugates to fought in past tense, not "fighted".

Regular expression for the FSA is:

c. L(FSA) is infinite, because if c occurs in q2, it can lead to q1 which can lead back to q0 (the initial state)
